## How to run the Exam System Server and Client
1. Open	the	ExamEngine.java class and run it (runs the exam	server)
2. Open	the	MathsClient.java class and run it (runs	the	exam client)
 - This	will return	an error as	the	RMI	registry is	not	running	yet
 - Note	that a directory called	out will be	created	within the Exam	System project directory
 - This	directory is where we need to run the RMI directory
3. Assuming	your machine can run javac – run the following commands	to run the RMI registry:
$ cd ~/java-workspace/ExamSystem/out/production/ExamSystem
$ rmiregistry
Commands are applicable	to Unix	based operating	systems
4. Re-run the ExamEngine.java class	and	the	MathsClient.java class
